               This College on the island of Bantayan, is located Northwest of Cebu. To reach Bantayan
               Island, one must travel by boat from Hagnaya Port in San Remigio to the port of the Municipality of
               Sta. Fe. From Sta. Fe, one must travel more than 22 kilometers to reach Madridejos, passing
               through the business center of the island, the Municipality of Bantayan. The town of Madridejos
               was originally called as “Lawis,” which means the endmost part of the island.
